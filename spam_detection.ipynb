    "# About the Dataset\n",
    "Hopkins et al. (1999) created the Spambase data set donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase). The data set contains 4,601 emails marked as spam or non-spam by a postmaster or individuals. Fifty-seven features aid in classifying emails as spam (e.g. word frequencies and email characteristics). The Spambase data set is used for developing and benchmarking spam detection models, providing a base for analysing the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective\n",
    "Develop a neural network with TensorFlow that can classify emails as spam or non-spam. .\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a sequential API\n",
    "- add layers as needed\n",
    "- employ the model pipeline (compile, fit, and evaluate)\n",
    "- present your insights based on the performance of the model."
